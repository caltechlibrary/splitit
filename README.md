_Split It!_ makes use of numerous open-source packages, without which it would have been effectively impossible to develop _Split It!_.  I want to acknowledge this debt.  In alphabetical order, the packages are:

* [ipdb](https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb) &ndash; the IPython debugger
* [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org) &ndash; a packaging program that creates standalone applications from Python programs for Windows, macOS, Linux and other platforms
